        According to the hypothesis, all numbers resulting from this form are prime numbers (except for the value n=5).
        In today's conditions, Fermat number was calculated for the last n=11 value.
        As a matter of fact, since it is too large for n>11 values, primality control could not be done.
        Fermat Numbers are calculated with this formula: (2^(2^n) + 1).*/
