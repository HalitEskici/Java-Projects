        (0: no promotion,1: promotion type 1, 2: promotion type 2) and finally whether the item is luxury or normal (1 luxury 0 normal).
        After entering all information about an item, the user presses ENTER key.
        When -1 is entered for number of purchases of the item this indicates the end of entry
        A typical screen is like that:

	                    #of Purchase	Name 	Price	Promotion Type(0-1-2)	Status (0-1)

        For new purchase: 	  2	        pan 	10.5	        1	              0  (ENTER)
        For new purchase: 	  1	        apple 	9	            0	              1  (ENTER)
        For new purchase: 	  1	        orange 	8.5	            0	              0  (ENTER)
        For new purchase: 	  -1

        In the purchase list, first 2 items are purchased, item name is pan, price is 10.5, promotion type 1 and the item is normal

        •	If promotion type is 0: no promotion
        If promotion type is 1 %10 discount is applied up to the total value of 50 $ and %20 discount is applied to the amount exceeding 50$
        (e.g. if price of meat is 30, 2 kg meat is purchased pay 50*0.9+10*0.8 =53 rather then 60)
        If promotion type is 2:  if total number of purchases exceeds 2, for the items exceeding 2 the charged price is half of the listed price
        (e.g. if three chocolates are purchased at 5 $ each, pay 2*5+1*2.5)
        •	For each product, first calculate the discount due to promotion then make the tax calculation
        •	For normal items value added tax (VAT) rate is 0.15, for luxury items 0.25
        •	Report the overalls as follows:
            Total gross payment without discounts and before VAT
            Total discount made
            Total net payments after discounts without VAT
            Total value added tax paid
            Total payment including VAT
        •	Give all necessary messages for the user (prompting users to enter specific values)
        •	Do all necessary controls (e.g. input checks)
